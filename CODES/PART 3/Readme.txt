Basic Image Visualization

Input Data: Images (based on the presence of image processing libraries and functions).
Output Data: Visualizations and possibly processed images.
Purpose:
The notebook imports libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and image processing (e.g., Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, OpenCV).
It defines functions for plotting images, displaying images, and plotting graphs related to images.
The presence of cv2 (OpenCV) indicates that the notebook is likely used for image manipulation or computer vision tasks.
Functions like plot_image, display_image, plot_graph, and plot_graph_ suggest that the notebook is used for visualizing and analyzing images, possibly with a focus on identifying patterns or features.

Advanced Image Analysis

Input Data: Images (based on the presence of image processing libraries and functions).
Output Data: Visualizations, possibly processed images, and results of machine learning model evaluations.
Purpose:
The notebook imports libraries for data manipulation, visualization, image processing (e.g., Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, OpenCV), and machine learning (e.g., scikit-learn models and metrics).
It defines functions similar to the first notebook for plotting and displaying images and graphs.
The presence of machine learning models (SVC, LinearRegression) and metrics (accuracy_score) indicates that the notebook likely involves training models on image data or features extracted from images.
The notebook seems to be used for a combination of image processing, visualization, and analyzing images through machine learning models.

Complex Model Insights

Input Data: Images (based on the presence of image processing libraries and functions).
Output Data: Visualizations, processed images, and results of machine learning model evaluations.
Purpose:
The notebook imports similar libraries as the previous ones for data manipulation, visualization, image processing (e.g., Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, OpenCV), and machine learning (e.g., scikit-learn models and metrics).
It defines functions for plotting images, displaying images, and performing mathematical operations (e.g., MinMaxScalar, sigmoid), which are often used in data preprocessing and feature engineering for machine learning models.
The presence of additional machine learning models (MultiOutputClassifier) and metrics (accuracy_score) suggests a focus on training and evaluating models on image data or extracted features, possibly with more complex model structures or multi-output scenarios.
Similar to "Advanced Image Analysis", this notebook seems to be used for a combination of image processing, visualization, and analyzing images through machine learning models but with potentially more complex models or data transformations.
